An exercise in model tracking and feature engineering

Disclaimer: This is not yet the final state of this repository. Notebooks are still a bit laconic. I'm currently working on making it more readable.

I am using a US house price dataset from a Kaggle competition. My goal here is not to find the most accurate answer possible
to the problem in hand. Instead, I will be running many different models and tracking their results on MlFlow.
Additionaly, I want to show some maturity in Feature Engineering, as a try to reduce the dimensionality of my dataframe
while minimizing the losses in model accuracy.
